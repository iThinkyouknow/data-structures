# Data Structures

## What
This repo is where I try to practise implementing different data structures in JavaScript.

## Note
1) Data structures will be implemented using normal functions
2) Data structures will not be implemented using constructor Functions and thus need not be instantiated with "new"
3) Try to use a monadic pattern where possible
